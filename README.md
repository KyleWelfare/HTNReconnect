## Motivation

We wanted to make something that could potentially help those struggling with the pandemic and lockdown. By recommending
fun, educational, and collaborative activities people can do at home, they stay safe while still having fun!

## Code

The front-end was done using primarily vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There was some jQuery used as well to control
certain element display toggles and to integrate the ionRangeSlider.

The back-end was done using Node.js, with MongoDB as the database, to store activity information.

Design prototyping was done in Figma. https://www.figma.com/file/BCvkOeG4O1kodhOABX1ivy/Reconnect?node-id=0%3A1

## How to Use It

Simply fill out the form on the landing page, and hit submit! You will be presented with a variety of activities
tailored to your specific form inputs.

## Future Development

Automation of database population would be required as the activity pool grows.

Integration of Google Calendar API to allow for scheduling of events between users, directly from their recommendation page.

More comprehensive form to improve specificity, variety, and accuracy of results.
